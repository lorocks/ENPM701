ultrasonic if below 30, stop take 10 and get mean and then do stuff

distance travel to block travel like half then recheck


height 40 found properly, below u need the delay
if height > 40 -> 2 forwards
if height < find which quadrant of image, break into 4 or 6 segments, pivot angle
forward and repeat until height 40

search and orient will take to wait some time for robot stable and then read image



block is 1.5 wide, pillar is 0.3 wide


FSM -
start
forward a little if not search immideately
searching and oreint
forward 1 [for forward 1 x > 320 or x +w < 320]
search and orient
forward 2
constantly flip between small forward and search and orient (Approach)
grab
reverse by forward 2 [ more precise turning]
turn to 90
forward till ultrasonic (dist)
turn 90
forward till ultrasonic (place_dist)
place block
reverse
reorient -> start


define min height for commiting to forward

##### think abt what if i over shoot or lose the object that needs to be found


State 0 - search and move by 1 feet towards quadrant, if no find come back to degree 0
and move forward by 1 foot and repeat



State 0 - go nearer to block state
State 1 - orient a little bit state
State 2 - perfect orietation
State 3 - Grab
State 4 - Send email
State 5 - Reverse out after checking if directly possible, if not change state
State 6 - check current pos and move to y wall, ultrasonic at [variable distance]
(Turn toward 180, drive till ultrasonic shows wall)
State 7 - turn to 90, move till ultrasonic [variable distance]
State 8 - place object
State 9 - reset for state 0
