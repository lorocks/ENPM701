ultrasonic if below 30, stop take 10 and get mean and then do stuff

distance travel to block travel like half then recheck


height 40 found properly, below u need the delay
if height > 40 -> 2 forwards
if height < find which quadrant of image, break into 4 or 6 segments, pivot angle
forward and repeat until height 40

search and orient will take to wait some time for robot stable and then read image


FSM -
start
forward a little if not search immideately
searching and oreint
forward 1 [for forward 1 x > 320 or x +w < 320]
search and orient
forward 2
constantly flip between small forward and search and orient (Approach)
grab
reverse by forward 2 [ more precise turning]
turn to 90
forward till ultrasonic (dist)
turn 90
forward till ultrasonic (place_dist)
place block
reverse
reorient -> start


define min height for commiting to forward
